**what is advanced Networking?**

Advanced networking allows Android apps to connect to other devices on the same network as your Windows PC.

Advanced networking in Android refers to the set of features and capabilities that allow developers to create applications that utilize complex networking functionalities beyond basic network communication. These features provide developers with more control and flexibility when working with network connections, data transfer, and protocols.

1. Network APIs:

2. Background Network Operations:

3. HTTP and HTTPS:

4. Network Security:

5. Network Profiling and Monitoring:

In home connect app, we use this advance networking for many purposes such as:

**Device Communication:**

The Home Connect app utilizes advanced networking to establish communication between the user's smartphone and the smart home devices. It can connect to devices over Wi-Fi or the internet to send commands and receive status updates.

**Remote Control:**

With advanced networking, the app enables users to remotely control their smart home devices from anywhere. For instance, a user can use the app to start their oven, change the washing machine settings, or adjust the temperature of their refrigerator. With the help of smartwatches we can see the status of the home connect appliances which is easy to use.

**Real-Time Feedback:**

The app utilizes advanced networking to provide real-time feedback on the status of the smart home devices. For example, the user can view the progress of a cooking process in the oven, check the remaining time of a washing machine cycle, or monitor the temperature settings of their refrigerator.

**Push Notifications:**

Advanced networking allows the Home Connect app to send push notifications to users. For instance, the app can notify users when a cooking process is complete, when a washing machine cycle finishes, or if there is an issue with any of the connected devices.

**Security and Authentication:**

The app ensures secure communication by utilizing encryption protocols such as HTTPS or SSL/TLS. It also incorporates authentication mechanisms to verify the user's identity and prevent unauthorized access to their smart home devices.

**Background Sync:**

The Home Connect app utilizes advanced networking techniques to perform background synchronization with the smart home devices. This allows it to retrieve the latest device data, update status changes, and ensure that the app's information remains up to date.

**Error Handling and Recovery:**

Advanced networking enables the app to handle network errors, such as loss of connectivity or timeouts when communicating with the smart home devices. It can implement error handling strategies and recovery mechanisms to ensure smooth user experience even in unreliable network conditions.

**What is Retrofit library?**

![retrofit](https://github.com/Vijaya9418/Advanced-Networking-in-android/assets/56352158/e54be804-c590-4622-9f42-6b231dae3fa7)


The Retrofit library is a widely used networking library that simplifies the process of making HTTP requests and handling the responses. It is developed by Square and provides a high-level API for interacting with web services.


Here's an example of how to use Retrofit in Android:

**1. Add the Retrofit dependencies to your project. You can do this by adding the following lines to your app-level build.gradle file:**

dependencies {

    // Other dependencies...
    
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0'
    
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0'  // JSON serialization
    
}



**2. Create a data model class that represents the structure of the data you expect to send or receive from the API. **

public class User {

    private int id;
    
    private String name;
    
    // ... Other properties, constructors, getters, and setters
    
}


**3. Define the API endpoints using an interface. Each method in the interface represents a specific API request. Annotate the methods with the appropriate HTTP method and endpoint path.**

public interface UserService {

    @GET("users")
    
    Call<List<User>> getUsers();
    
}


**4. Create a Retrofit instance and specify the base URL of the API. You can do this in your application's initialization code or in a dedicated class. For example:**

Retrofit retrofit = new Retrofit.Builder()

    .baseUrl("https://api.example.com/")
    
    .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
    
    .build();

UserService userService = retrofit.create(UserService.class);


**5. Make API requests by calling the methods defined in the interface. Wrap the result in a Call object, which represents the asynchronous request.**

Call<List<User>> call = userService.getUsers();

call.enqueue(new Callback<List<User>>() {

    @Override
    
    public void onResponse(Call<List<User>> call, Response<List<User>> response) {
    
        if (response.isSuccessful()) {
        
            List<User> users = response.body();
            
            // Process the list of users
            
        } 
        else
        {
        
            // Handle error
            
        }
        
    }

    @Override
    
    public void onFailure(Call<List<User>> call, Throwable t) {
    
        // Handle network error
        
    }
    
});
