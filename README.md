**what is advanced Networking?**

Advanced networking allows Android apps to connect to other devices on the same network as your Windows PC.

Advanced networking in Android refers to the set of features and capabilities that allow developers to create applications that utilize complex networking functionalities beyond basic network communication. These features provide developers with more control and flexibility when working with network connections, data transfer, and protocols.

1. Network APIs:

2. Background Network Operations:

3. HTTP and HTTPS:

4. Network Security:

5. Network Profiling and Monitoring:

In home connect app, we use this advance networking for many purposes such as:

**Device Communication:**

The Home Connect app utilizes advanced networking to establish communication between the user's smartphone and the smart home devices. It can connect to devices over Wi-Fi or the internet to send commands and receive status updates.

**Remote Control:**

With advanced networking, the app enables users to remotely control their smart home devices from anywhere. For instance, a user can use the app to start their oven, change the washing machine settings, or adjust the temperature of their refrigerator. With the help of smartwatches we can see the status of the home connect appliances which is easy to use.

**Real-Time Feedback:**

The app utilizes advanced networking to provide real-time feedback on the status of the smart home devices. For example, the user can view the progress of a cooking process in the oven, check the remaining time of a washing machine cycle, or monitor the temperature settings of their refrigerator.

**Push Notifications:**

Advanced networking allows the Home Connect app to send push notifications to users. For instance, the app can notify users when a cooking process is complete, when a washing machine cycle finishes, or if there is an issue with any of the connected devices.

**Security and Authentication:**

The app ensures secure communication by utilizing encryption protocols such as HTTPS or SSL/TLS. It also incorporates authentication mechanisms to verify the user's identity and prevent unauthorized access to their smart home devices.

**Background Sync:**

The Home Connect app utilizes advanced networking techniques to perform background synchronization with the smart home devices. This allows it to retrieve the latest device data, update status changes, and ensure that the app's information remains up to date.

**Error Handling and Recovery:**

Advanced networking enables the app to handle network errors, such as loss of connectivity or timeouts when communicating with the smart home devices. It can implement error handling strategies and recovery mechanisms to ensure smooth user experience even in unreliable network conditions.
